Update notes and TODO here:

TODO:
Added inventory system courtesy of a tutorial by KNCHgames.com 
This style of coding was beyond my skills and since i read this tutorial a 
while ago and never coded it i figured the inventory system was something 
i really liked the idea of so credits to that site for the inventory.
	
So the Registry has been added into the game for purpose im not even 
sure about. The cards will be held in there until i find a way to use the 
registry better with other variables. I do know it will be helpful for when i add
an inventory to hold the cards earned within the game.
	
These numbers will be assigned to different cards as the
cards are drawn into the game. Once the number is being held
as active it will initiate and battle type. Meaning strengths/weaknesses
etc will be effective in the battle. This is the only way i can think
of making the cards have a type ingame and it seems the most effective
way of doing. 

Having attempted to extend the playstate into sprite.as as a test
it failed epically. Luckily i believe my numbers in the update loop
should hopefully make lighter work of what im wanting to achieve within
the game. 
After this is working, more cards will be added and then ill be able
to code the rare cards and legend cards, also make my NPC and start 
making xp ratios for certain cards killed in battle. 
The other hard part is making some form of enemy to fight against. I
have an idea on that too. The flxmath.rand(1,50) and assign the opponent
moves per number and it will make the whole thing alot more random
and fair. 

For now this is my readme updated.
