SIDE NOTE
=========
Since im temp suspended on twitter on the account @heppell08
i will be using @heppell87 until i am able to recover that account.

Pretty huge updates have been happening because i have "SORT OF" added
a gamesave system but because of the complexity of the way im trying to save i have a huge
amount of debug code to write to keep the buttons, cards, health and sprite all onscreen
after i have the game loaded in the new state. I did have a loadgame button but im beginning 
to suspect it is useless because when tracing the card numbers in a function in xp gain its 
tracing the number as if its loaded but i didnt load. So it must natively loadgame the way 
ive coded it so im going to change the loadgame button to a load eraser instead so that if needs 
be then the save may be erased and a restart can occur. I am not having multiple save as i believe
that will become VERY erroneous until i sort out the main save system itself. I still have cards 
i need to add and i still have a huge amount of math coding to complete aswell. So for now the 
code is updated in github but i'm still a long way from completion.

I also have beent thinking of adding an RPG element to the game and in the near future
that may become a reality but for now i will have it as a stand alone game as cards
and maybe work on the RPG bit on the side.
