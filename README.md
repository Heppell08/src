Update notes and TODO here:

TODO:
Make types of number for the following:
	Type 1) Fire
    Type 2) Water
	Type 3) Earth
	Type 4) Wind
	Type 5) Legend Ability
	Type 6) Power Up
	
These numbers will be assigned to different cards as the
cards are drawn into the game. Once the number is being held
as active it will initiate and battle type. Meaning strengths/weaknesses
etc will be effective in the battle. This is the only way i can think
of making the cards have a type ingame and it seems the most effective
way of doing. 

Having attempted to extend the playstate into sprite.as as a test
it failed epically. Luckily i believe my numbers in the update loop
should hopefully make lighter work of what im wanting to achieve within
the game. 
After this is working, more cards will be added and then ill be able
to code the rare cards and legend cards, also make my NPC and start 
making xp ratios for certain cards killed in battle. 
The other hard part is making some form of enemy to fight against. I
have an idea on that too. The flxmath.rand(1,50) and assign the opponent
moves per number and it will make the whole thing alot more random
and fair. 

For now this is my readme updated.
